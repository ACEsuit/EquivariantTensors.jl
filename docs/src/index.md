# EquivariantTensors

These pages contain the documentation for [EquivariantTensors](https://github.com/ACEsuit/EquivariantTensors.jl). This package provides tools to construct equivariant tensor layers to be used in equivariant models, as well as computational kernels to evaluate those layers.

The package is a work in progress. The plan is that it becomes the backend for several [ACEsuit]() packages such as [ACEpotentials.jl](https://github.com/ACEsuit/ACEpotentials.jl) and [ACEhamiltonians.jl](https://github.com/ACEsuit/ACEhamiltonians.jl).
